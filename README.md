# pywal-kde-script

Changing theme for KDE Applications (and Firefox).

## Requirements

- [pywal-kde](https://github.com/the404devs/pywal-kde) - Regular pywal may work too but it didn't work for me.
- [pywalfox](https://github.com/Frewacom/pywalfox)
- [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pywalfox/)

## How it works

```Bash
.\pywal.sh \path\to\file\
```
